## Some SharePoint Approval Workflows Bugs

1. Start this workflow when a new item is created.
2. Start this workflow when an item is changed.

I came accross a situation where the approval workflow works when disabling the 'Start this workflow when an item is changd.'
There is some documentation out there stating that these two states can conflict with each other in the workflow.
